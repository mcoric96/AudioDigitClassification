# Project Summary

This project focuses on building an audio digit classification system using Python. The main goal is to recognize spoken digits from audio files using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement

Accurately identifying spoken digits from audio recordings is a challenging task due to variations in speech, background noise, and recording quality. The project aims to develop a robust solution for digit recognition from audio data.

## Solution Overview

The solution involves:
- Preparing and processing an audio digit dataset.
- Designing and training a neural network model for classification.
- Evaluating the model's performance.
- Providing utility functions for data handling and preprocessing.

## Process Breakdown

### 1. Data Preparation (`audio_digit_dataset.py`)
- Loads and preprocesses audio files containing spoken digits.
- Extracts features (e.g., MFCCs) suitable for machine learning.
- Splits data into training and testing sets.

### 2. Model Definition (`audio_model.py`)
- Implements a neural network architecture tailored for audio classification.
- Defines layers, activation functions, and output for digit prediction.

### 3. Training and Evaluation (`digit_classifier.py`)
- Trains the model using the processed dataset.
- Evaluates accuracy and performance on test data.
- Handles model saving and loading for reuse.

### 4. Utilities (`utils.py`)
- Provides helper functions for audio processing, feature extraction, and data management.
- Ensures reproducibility and efficient workflow.

## Conclusion

By integrating data preparation, model design, training, and utility functions, this project delivers an end-to-end solution for audio digit classification. The modular structure allows easy adaptation and extension for similar audio recognition tasks.
